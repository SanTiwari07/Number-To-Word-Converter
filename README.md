# Number-To-Word-Converter
This repository contains a C++ program that converts a numerical input into its corresponding word representation. The code supports numbers ranging from single digits to billions and properly formats the output into readable English phrases.
# Features:
# Input Handling:
Accepts numeric input as a string to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.
Dynamically adjusts the number formatting based on the length of the input.

# Word Conversion:
Handles single digits, teens, tens, hundreds, and larger place values like thousands, millions, and billions.
Uses predefined arrays for word mappings, such as "ten", "twenty", "hundred", etc.

# Modular Design:
A format function processes a three-digit segment of the number for easy reuse.
Ensures proper formatting of the output, including handling zeros and significant figures.

# Scalability:
Can easily be extended to handle even larger numbers by adding new place value terms.
Dynamically calculates the required array size to accommodate the input length.
